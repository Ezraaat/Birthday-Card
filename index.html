                        <strong>Dear Julia</strong>
                        <p>
                            First of all, congratulations on making it through another shitty year of life. Wish you to suffer more lol. Kidding aside, Happy birthday! I hope you're experiencing joy and happiness as you read this message. TBH I'm not a fan of giving long letters or messages. Besides, we've only been speaking to one another a few days ago. I don't know what to say to you because of this HAHAHA. So, rather than giving you a protracted phony message. I'll just share some words with you that you might find helpful in your life.<br> 
                            <br>
                            Just like the delicate butterfly, life undergoes a metamorphosis. We grow, we learn, and we evolve with each experience. And though the winds of change may sometimes be daunting, they bring forth new opportunities for growth and understanding. May you embrace this uncertainty that life presents to us, for it is through uncertainties that we find the courage to explore new horizons and discover our true selves. In the grand theater of life, you are both the protagonist and the audience. Each day unfolds like a new act, and the choices you make contribute to the plotline. Embrace the power of choice and the responsibility that comes with it, for it is through mindful decisions that we craft the narrative of our lives. May you never lack reasons to smile and may you always find happiness in the little things in life. Amen! HAHAHA <33
